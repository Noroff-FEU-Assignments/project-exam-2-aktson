# SocialMe

This is my submission for Project Exam 2. SocialMe is a social media app where people can create free account and can create/edit/delete post, can comment and react on any post. A user may also follow and un-follow any other profile on the app.

The project was built using the https://noroff-api-docs.netlify.app/

## Getting Started with socialMe App

Clone the repo. Make sure you have node and npm installed on you machine.

Install dependency:

### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run following command to start project:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

# Register a profile:

## To create account you will need following

### <h4>username: all small caps and no special charaters allowed<h4>

### <h4>email: an email ending in @stud.noroff.no eg:(example@stud.noroff.no)<h4>

### <h4>password: must be atleast 8 character<h4>

### <h4>confirm-password: retype password<h4>

You wiil then be redirected to authenticated Home page where you can update your profile picture and do post activity mentioned above.
