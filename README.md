# SocialMe

This is my submission for Project Exam 2. SocialMe is a social media app where people can create free account and can create/edit/delete post, can comment and react on any post. A user may also follow and un-follow any other profile on the app.

The project was built using the https://noroff-api-docs.netlify.app/
